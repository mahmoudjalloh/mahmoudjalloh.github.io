I am Teaching Fellow at St. Johns College, Santa Fe. I teach the “Great Books”. Before moving to Santa Fe, I did a PhD in philosophy at the University of Southern California. Before moving to LA, I studied physics and philosophy at Northeastern University.

I have interests in the history and philosophy of science, particularly physics, and related areas in metaphysics. I also have interests in the history of philosophy, particularly Kant, Wittgenstein, and phenomenology.

You can also find my work online at [PhilPeople](https://philpeople.org/profiles/mahmoud-jalloh), [academic.edu](https://usc.academia.edu/MahmoudJalloh), and the [philsci-archive](http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/id/user/66772).
